# Finger exercise in Section 3.2 of Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python
# Description: Let s be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers
#  separated by commas, e.g., s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'. Write a program that prints
#  the sum of the numbers in s.


# Get string of numbers from user
s = input("Enter a series of numbers separated by commas (no spaces), then hit enter to find the sum:")
mod_s = str()
total = 0


# For loop that runs through user string and adds anything to the modified string mod_s that is not a comma
# By the time the loop hits a comma, mod_s contains the digits and decimals for one number in the list

for x in s:
    
    if x != ",":                    # If x is not a comma
      mod_s = mod_s + str(x)        # Convert x to string and add to mod_s

    else:                           # If x is a comma
      total = total + float(mod_s)  # Convert mod_s to float and add to total
      mod_s = str()                 # Reset mod_s

    print(mod_s)

total = total + float(mod_s)        # Since the last character in the string s is not a comma, the for loop does not know to add mod_s to total one more time. Hence this line.
print("Sum:", total)
